# simple-socket-chat
My attempt at learning and experimenting with socket.io rooms for a future project. This probably isn't the best approach to to this (far from it I'd say), but this was a basic mockup to test out socket.io rooms. I also tried to use Classes in NodeJS, something I've never done before. All in all, this project took about 6 hours to complete.
